# Lexis-Nexis Toolbox

Query Lexis/Nexis via their WebServices API, and manage the search results. Sample usage:

   1. edit pre-configurations in ./bin/search.sh
   2. ./bin/search.sh
   3. ./bin/batches2files.sh
   4. ./bin/files2tsv.sh

The result will be a TSV stream summarizing the search result. Redirect the results to a file and open it in your favorite spreadsheet application.
